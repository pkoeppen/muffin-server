# *chan

Uploaded for Bitbond. (I have a habit of finishing a full MVP on my local machine before pushing any of it to Github. Terrible, I know.)

*chan (pronounced "starchan") is a modern take on early-2000s imageboards like [Tinyboard](https://github.com/savetheinternet/Tinyboard). This was my second-most-recent pet project. My most recent project - a video subscription service akin to Twitch - is still in the works.
